# About Static NG-DBSCAN

- Inside "Static NG-DBSCAN Code" folder, all the files to run are present.
- While plotting 2 and 3 dimensional datasets, try changing epsilon values to get better cluster quality.
- Images folder contains some of the clusters generated. 
- For synthetic datasets, we used moon, blob and circular datasets.

### Instructions to run the Static NG-DBSCAN Code:

<details>
<summary> Generate Synthetic Datasets </summary>
	 
	- Use dataset_generator.py. 

	- Enter number of points (or number of sentences in case of text dataset) and type of dataset.(use upto 10000 for fast running).

	- Run the following command and the dataset will be generated in points.txt file:
		- python3 dataset_generator.py

</details>

<details>
<summary> Run the Static NG-DBSCAN Algorithm </summary>

	- Run the main algorithm (NG-DBSCAN) using command: 
		- g++ phase2.cpp
		- ./a.out
	
	- It will create clusters.txt which contains all the clusters. 

	- Now to plot the clusters (for 2 and 3 dimensional datasets), use the following command:
		- python3 clusters_generator.py 

</details>

<details>
<summary> Calculate metrics and compare results of NG-DBSCAN and DBSCAN </summary>

	- We calculated these NG-DBSCAN metrics for comparison with DBSCAN: compactness, separation, recall. Use the following command for calculating NG-DBSCAN metrics. 
		- g++ ngdbscan_metrics_main.cpp
		- ./a.out

	- Run DBSCAN algorithm (for comparison with NG-DBSCAN) over points.txt using dbscan_code.py using the following command:
		- python3 dbscan_code.py

	- We calculated the DBSCAN metrics: compactness, separation, recall. Use the following command for calculating DBSCAN metrics.
		- g++ dbscan_metrics_main.cpp
		- ./a.out

	- Using this we can compare between DBSCAN and NG-DBSCAN.

# About Incremental NG-DBSCAN

- Inside "Incremental NG-DBSCAN Code" folder, all the files to run are present.
- Try to tune the parameters while running on different datasets to get more accuracy.
- Inside each dataset of 2 dimension, images of cluster plotting are also present. 
- For synthetic datasets, we used moon, blob and circular datasets.

### Instructions to run the Incremental NG-DBSCAN Code:

<details>
<summary> Generate and Plot the already existing dataset (which is considered as database in real life) </summary>
	
	- First put the points.txt, queries.txt, parameters_incr, parameters_static for the dataset you want the algorithm to run on.

	- Then first run the static version without considering the queries.txt using the following command. Here first argument = 1 to copy the value of parameters. Second command line argument will be 0 here. 
		- g++ static_ngdbscan.cpp 
		- ./a.out 1 0

	- It will create old_epsilon_graph.txt, old_clusters.txt, old_points.txt and this will constitute our database.

	- To plot the clusters for the points present in database, we will run the following command:
		- python3 clusters_generator.py 0

</details>

<details> 
<summary> Run and Plot the Incremental NG-DBSCAN algorithm over the existing dataset </summary>

	- Now to run the queries.txt over incremental version, use the following command. 
		- g++ incr_ngdbscan.cpp 
		- ./a.out 1

	- After this, new_epsilon_graph.txt, new_clusters.txt, new_points.txt will be generated.

	- To plot the clusters for the points after considering queries.txt, we will run the following command:
		- python3 clusters_generator.py 1

</details>

<details>
<summary> Run and Plot the Static NG-DBSCAN algorithm over the existing dataset (for comparison with incremental version) </summary>

	- Now to run the queries.txt over incremental version (for comparison with incremental version), use the following command. Here first argument = 1 to copy the value of parameters. Second command line argument will be 1 here. 
		- g++ static_ngdbscan.cpp
		- ./a.out 1 1

	- After this, new_epsilon_graph.txt, new_clusters.txt, new_points.txt will be generated.

<details>
<summary> Calculate metrics on Incremental and Static Versions for comparison </summary>

		- ./a.out 0

	- To calculate and store metrics on the incremental version, we will use the following command:
		- g++ metrics_main.cpp
