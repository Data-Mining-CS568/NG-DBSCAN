# About Static NG-DBSCAN

- Inside "Static NG-DBSCAN Code" folder, all the files to run are present.
- While plotting 2 and 3 dimensional datasets, try changing epsilon values to get better cluster quality.
- Images folder contains some of the clusters generated. 
- For synthetic datasets, we used moon, blob and circular datasets.

### Instructions to run the Static NG-DBSCAN Code:

<details>
<summary> Generate Dataset </summary>
	 
		- Use dataset_generator.py. 

		- Enter number of points (or number of sentences in case of text dataset) and type of dataset.(use upto 10000 for fast running) 
		- Run command dataset will be generate in points.txt file:
			- python3 dataset_generator.py
</details>

```
- Run the main algorithm (NG-DBSCAN) using command: 
	- g++ phase2.cpp
	- ./a.out
- It will create clusters.txt which contains all the clusters. 

- Now to plot the clusters (for 2D and 3D dataset), use the following command:
	- python3 clusters_generator.py 

```



<details>
<summary> Metrics Calculation and Comparison </summary>

	- We calculated the NG-DBSCAN metrics for comparison with DBSCAN: compactness, separation, recall 
		- g++ metrics_main.cpp
		- ./a.out

	- Ran DBSCAN algorithm (for comparison with NG-DBSCAN) over points.txt using dbscan_code.py using the following command:
		- python3 dbscan_code.py

	- We calculated the DBSCAN metrics: compactness, separation, recall 
		- g++ dbscan_metrics_main.cpp
		- ./a.out
	- Using this we can compare between DBSCAN and NG-DBSCAN.

# About Incremental NG-DBSCAN

- Inside "Incremental NG-DBSCAN Code" folder, all the files to run are present.
- Try to tune the parameters while running on different datasets to get more accuracy.
- Inside each dataset of 2 dimension, images of cluster plotting are also present. 
- For synthetic datasets, we used moon, blob and circular datasets.

### Instructions to run the Incremental NG-DBSCAN Code:

	- First put the points.txt and queries.txt for the dataset you want the algorithm to run on.

	- Then first run the static version without considering the queries.txt using the following command:
		- g++ static_ngdbscan.cpp 
		- ./a.out 0
	- It will create old_epsilon_graph.txt, old_clusters.txt, old_points.txt and this will constitute our database.

	- To plot the clusters for the points present in database, we will run the following command:
		- python3 clusters_generator.py 0

	- Now to run the queries.txt over incremental version, use the following command. 
		- g++ incr_ngdbscan.cpp 
		- ./a.out 
	
	- After this, new_epsilon_graph.txt, new_clusters.txt, new_points.txt will be generated.

	- To plot the clusters for the points after considering queries.txt, we will run the following command:
		- python3 clusters_generator.py 1

	- Now to run the queries.txt over incremental version (for comparison with incremental version), use the following command. 
		- g++ static_ngdbscan.cpp  
		- ./a.out 1
	- After this, new_epsilon_graph.txt, new_clusters.txt, new_points.txt will be generated.

	- To plot the clusters for the points after considering queries.txt, we will run the following command:
		- python3 clusters_generator.py 1 

	- To use metrics on the database (only considering points.txt), we will use the following command:
		- g++ metrics_main.cpp 
		- ./a.out 0

	- To use metrics on the updated dataset (after considering queries.txt), we will use the following command:
		- g++ metrics_main.cpp 
		- ./a.out 1
