Incremental:
Parameters(int k = 15, int Mmax = 30, int iter = 25, double epsilon = 1.25, int Minpts = 4, int threshold = 1000)

Static:
iter = 20;
xTn = 0.001;		// limits number of nodes in NG for termination
xTr = 0.0001;		// limits number of removed nodes in current iteration in NG
k = 20;				// represents degree of each node in neighbour graph
Mmax = 40;			// used to reduce NG in phase-1 to reduce computation
p = 3;				// limits nodes for which 2 hop distance is calculated in NG
epsilon = 1.25;		// minimum distance b/w nodes 
Minpts  = 6;
